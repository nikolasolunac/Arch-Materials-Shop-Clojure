# materials-shop-clj

A Clojure project designed with Leiningen that presents shop for architectural materials, with buyers and items. It uses korma for MySQL communication, ring as a web server, composure-api as a REST API framework and lein/ring for binding with Leiningen. For API testing, this project uses Swagger.

## prerequisites

This project uses Clojure 1.9.0 on Java 1.8.0 and it is developed in the Windows OS with mandatory extension: Chocolatey package manager. Database for this app is in 'baza/' folder and can be executed in MySQL. Visual Studio Code was used for writting code and it is recommended IDE for this project.

## run

To run the app use 'lein ring server' in the root of the project (this will open Swagger API).

## architecture

/baza/ - holds latest database;

/src/dbbroker/ - contains individual entities related to SQL logic;

/src/dbkonekcija/ - provides a connection to the MySQL server;

/src/domen/ - holds the domain entities (same as ones in database tables);

/src/kontroler/ - contains application logic (API CRUD routes);

/src/util/ - utility helpers.
